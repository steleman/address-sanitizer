#summary AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.

= Overview =

Currently the kernel has the following configs:

CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
 * Enables red-zoning and poisoning
 * Can detect some out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and use-after-free (UAF)
 * Does not detect OOB reads
 * Best-effort UAF detection

CONFIG_KMEMCHECK
 * CONFIG_KMEMCHECK is a heavy-handed uninitialized memory access checker which causes page-fault on every memory access
 * Slow

CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
 * Unmaps freed pages from address space
 * Can detect some UAF accesses
 * Detects UAF only when the whole page is unused

We are going to implement:

CONFIG_ASAN
 * Fast and comprehensive solution for UAF and OOB
 * Based on compiler instrumentation (fast)
 * OOB for both writes and reads
 * Strong UAF detection
 * Prompt detection of bad memory accesses
 * Informative reports
