#summary intra-object-overflow bugs

One class of bugs currently not properly detected by AddressSanitizer is *intra-object-overflow*:

{{{
struct S {
  int buffer[5];
  int other_field;
};

void Foo(S *s, int idx) {
  s->buffer[idx] = 0;  // if idx == 5, asan will not complain
}

}}}


This class of bugs will be detectable with the [IntelMemoryProtectionExtensions Intel MPX]. 

In the meantime, we are trying the following approach in AddressSanitizer:
if the type is a C++ non-standard-layout class with a destructor, we add poisoned gaps (redzones) between fields in the class.

Stay tuned.
