#summary Slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer

= Spec CPU 2006 (C/C++) =

These numbers are measured on [http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/ Spec CPU 2006] (C/C++ only) using AddressSanitizer r496 (clang -O2 -fsanitize=address)
with `malloc_context_size=1` (i.e. no unwinding).

The baseline is `clang -O2`. <BR>
The average slowdown introduced by full instrumentation (red) is *1.73*.<BR>
When only writes are instrumented (blue), the average slowdown is *1.26*.
