#summary AddressSanitizer as a shared library

== ASAN as a shared library ==
Today, ASAN in Clang on Linux is offered only in the form of static library.
(e.g. `libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.a`)
On most other platforms ASAN is offered only in the form of DSO due to platform limitations.
The GCC variant of ASAN offers both static and DSO variants and DSO is the default.

It is easy to build a usable ASAN-DSO from LLVM tree: 
{{{
cd $LLVM/projects/compiler-rt/lib
clang -o asan.so  -DASAN_USE_PREINIT_ARRAY=0 -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -I. -O2 -fPIC -shared \
  asan/*.cc sanitizer_common/*.cc interception/*.cc lsan/lsan_common*.cc -ldl -lpthread -lm 
}}}

However, if we are going to officially support ASAN-DSO on Linux, 
we need to understand and document all its properties.

Cons: 
  * Worse performance (ASAN run-time is called via PLT even in the main executable)
  * issue 147 (can't use -static-libstdc++)
  * Potential version conflicts (the binary is linked against incompatible DSO version)
  * Harder deployment (need to carry the DSO around)
Pros:
  * Smaller disk usage
  * Potential ability to bring old ASAN-ified binaries to new systems
  * Ability to LD_PRELOAD ASAN-DSO, see below.

==ASAN and LD_PRELOAD ==
It is possible to use AddressSanitizer in this scenario: 
  * There is third-party executable binary which can not be recompiled 
  * It loads shared libraries that can be recompiled and we want to instrument them with AddressSanitizer

A simple solution is to build ASAN-DSO and LD_PRELOAD it into the process, however the devil is in the detail.
