#summary This page describes the level of AddressSanitizer run-time and compiler support for various platforms

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />


=Platforms=
== x86/x86_64 Linux ==
Just works, this is the primary platforms for the developers. 

== x86/x86_64 Darwin (OSX) ==
Just works, but the machinery used to intercept functions (mach_override) may soon be replaced with another one (function interposition)

== ARM Android ==
Works (TODO(eugenis))

== ARM iOS ==
Doing baby steps, help is welcome.

== x86 Windows== 
Small C-only tests work, help is welcome.

== PowerPC32/PowerPC64 Linux == 
We've been notified that small tests work. 
TODO: describe the differences (e.g. the shadow mapping, offset, page size, etc)

== SPARC Linux == 
The run-time library is known to build on SPARC Linux. 

=Compilers= 
==Clang/LLVM==
Just works, this is the primary compiler for the developers. 
==GCC==
The first version is in trunk, will appear in 4.8 release. 
The implementation is not 100% complete (TODO(kcc): links to bugs), but works.
