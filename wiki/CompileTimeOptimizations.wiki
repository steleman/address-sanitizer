#summary Compile-time optimizations for AddressSanitizer

=Introduction=
AddressSanitizer does not need to instrument all memory accesses to find all bugs.

The simplest example:
{{{
void inc(int *a) {
  (*a)++;
}
}}}
Here we have two memory accesses, load and store,
but we need to instrument only the first one.

Currently, we have very few optimizations implemented.
Some of the possible optimizations are listed below.
Your suggestions are welcome.

Instrument only the first access.
{{{
*a = ...
if (...)
  *a = ...
}}}

Instrument only the second access
{{{
if (...)
  *a = ...
*a = ...
}}}

Instrument this loop with `__asan_region_is_poisoned(a, n*sizeof(*a))` and avoid instrumenting individual accesses.
{{{
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  a[i] = ...;
}}}

Combine two accesses into one
{{{
struct { int a, b; } x;  ...
x.a = ...;
x.b = ...;
}}}

No point in instrumenting accesses to scalar globals
{{{
int glob;
int get_glob() {
  return glob;
}
}}}
