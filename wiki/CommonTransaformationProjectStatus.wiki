== opt1 (optimize-fast-memory-checks) ==
This pass removes fast load/store checks (ones where the memory object is known and valid at the time of the check) if it can prove that the access is entirely inside the memory object.

== opt2 (optimize-identical-ls-checks) ==
This pass removes identical load/store checks that appear in the same basic block.
It works by iterating over the calls in a basic block.
If any call is encountered then one of three things happens:
1) It is a load/store check with a previously unseen access pointer and size pair. The pair is added to the known accesses cache.
2) It is a load/store check with a previously seen access pointer and size pair. The check is removed.
3) It is another call that is not in a whitelist of functions known to not deallocate memory. The known access cache is cleared.

== opt3 (optimize-implied-fast-ls-checks) ==
This pass removes fast load/store checks that are implied by other fast load/store checks.
It works by traversing a dominator tree to find out which checks must always happen before other checks.
It removes fast load/store checks that are dominated by another fast load/store check with the same access offset and size pair.
