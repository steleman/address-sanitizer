=Introduction=

AddressSanitizer (aka ASan) is a memory error detector for C/C++.
It finds:
  * [ExampleUseAfterFree Use after free] (dangling pointer dereference)
  * [ExampleHeapOutOfBounds Heap buffer overflow]
  * [ExampleStackOutOfBounds Stack buffer overflow]
  * [ExampleGlobalOutOfBounds Global buffer overflow]
  * [ExampleUseAfterReturn Use after return]

This tool is very fast. The average slowdown of the instrumented program is ~2x (see PerformanceNumbers).

The tool consists of a compiler instrumentation module (currently, an LLVM pass)
and a run-time library which replaces the `malloc` function.

The tool works on x86 Linux and Mac.

=Getting !AddressSanitizer=

AddressSanitizer is a part of LLVM starting with version 3.1 and will be a part of GCC starting with version 4.8 <BR>
You can download pre-built Clang/LLVM binaries from http://llvm.org/releases/

The Chromium team periodically bakes fresh LLVM/Clang binaries, which include AddressSanitizer support. 
Simply execute the following:
{{{
mkdir -p tools/clang
cd tools/clang
svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/tools/clang/scripts
cd ../../
tools/clang/scripts/update.sh
# Now use third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/bin/{clang,clang++}
}}}

So far, AddressSanitizer has been tested only on Linux Ubuntu 10.04, 64-bit
(it can run both 64- and 32-bit programs) and Mac 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8.

If you want to build AddressSanitizer yourself, refer to HowToBuild.

= Using !AddressSanitizer =
In order to use AddressSanitizer you will need to compile and link your program using `clang` with the `-fsanitize=address` switch. <BR>
To get a reasonable performance add `-O1` or higher. <BR>
To get nicer stack traces in error messages add `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`. <BR>
Note: [http://llvm.org/releases/3.1/tools/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.html Clang 3.1 release uses another flag syntax].

{{{
% cat tests/use-after-free.c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  char *x = (char*)malloc(10 * sizeof(char*));
  free(x);
  return x[5];
}
% ../clang_build_Linux/Release+Asserts/bin/clang -fsanitize=address -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g   tests/use-after-free.c
}}}

Now, run the executable.

{{{

=Interaction with other tools=
==gdb==
You can use [http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/ gdb] with
binaries built by AddressSanitizer in a usual way.
When AddressSanitizer finds a bug it calls one of the functions `__asan_report_{load,store}{1,2,4,8,16}`
which in turn calls `__asan_report_error`.
If you want gdb to stop before asan reports an error, set a breakpoint on `__asan_report_error`. <BR>
If you want gdb to stop after asan has reported an error, set a breakpoint on `AsanDie` or use `ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1`.

Inside gdb you can ask asan to describe a memory location:
{{{
(gdb) set overload-resolution off
(gdb) p __asan_describe_address(0x7ffff73c3f80)
0x7ffff73c3f80 is located 0 bytes inside of 10-byte region [0x7ffff73c3f80,0x7ffff73c3f8a)
freed by thread T0 here: 
...
}}}


==ulimit -v==
The `ulimit -v` command can be used with ASan-ified binaries.
However, you should remember that ASan consumes 16 terabytes of virtual memory for shadow state and the `ulimit -v` value should be set accordingly.
For example, the following script may be used as a wrapper for `ulimit -v`:
{{{
#!/bin/bash
LIMIT_IN_GIGABYTES=$1
shift
# The value to pass to ulimit is 2^44+$LIMIT_IN_GIGABYTES bytes
ASAN_LIMIT=$(echo "(2^44 + $LIMIT_IN_GIGABYTES * 2^30) / 2^10" | bc -q)
echo ASAN_LIMIT: $ASAN_LIMIT
ulimit -v $ASAN_LIMIT
"$@"
}}}


=Flags=
See the separate [Flags Flags page].

=Call stack=
AddressSanitizer collects call stacks on the following events:
  * `malloc` and `free`
  * thread creation
  * failure

`malloc` and `free` happen relatively frequently and it is important to unwind the call stack fast.
AddressSanitizer uses a simple unwinder that relies on frame pointers.

If you don't care about `malloc`/`free` call stacks, simply disable the unwinder completely
(`malloc_context_size=0`).

Each stack frame needs to be symbolized (of course, if the binary is compiled with debug info).
Given a PC, we need to print
{{{
  #0xabcdf function_name file_name.cc:1234
}}}

Currently, AddressSanitizer does not have an in-process symbolizer.
You will need to filter the log file through `scripts/asan_symbolize.py` to get the symbols.
This script takes an optional parameter -- a file prefix.
The substring `.*prefix` will be removed from the file names.
{{{
% ./a.out
    ...
    #0 0x402c77 (/home/you/address-sanitizer/asan/a.out+0x402c77)
    ...
% ./a.out 2>&1  | ../scripts/asan_symbolize.py
   ...
   #0 0x402c77 in main /home/you/address-sanitizer/asan/use-after-free.c:5
   ...
% ./a.out 2>&1  | ../scripts/asan_symbolize.py /you/
   ...
   #0 0x402c77 in main address-sanitizer/asan/use-after-free.c:5
   ...
}}}
There is also an out-of-process symbolizer based on LLVM libraries (currently under development) that can be run by AddressSanitizer in a separate subprocess and symbolize stack traces online. If you have
a [http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/HowToBuild cmake build of LLVM] and compiler-rt, you can build this symbolizer:
{{{
cd /path/to/llvm_cmake_build/projects/compiler-rt/utils/llvm-symbolizer
make
SYMBOLIZER_PATH=`pwd`/llvm-symbolizer
}}}
You may use it in ASan in the following manner:
{{{
export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=${SYMBOLIZER_PATH}
ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=1 ./a.out
}}}

=Turning off instrumentation=
In some cases a particular function should be ignored (not instrumented) by AddressSanitizer:
  * Ignore a very hot function known to be correct to speedup the app.
  * Ignore a function that does some low-level magic (e.g. walking through the thread's stack bypassing the frame boundaries). 
  * Don't report a know problem. 
In either case, be *very careful*. 

To ignore certain functions, one can use the *no_address_safety_analysis*
attribute supported by Clang (3.1+) and GCC (4.8+). You can define the following macro:
{{{
#if defined(__clang__) || defined (__GNUC__)
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_ADDRESS_SAFETY_ANALYSIS __attribute__((no_address_safety_analysis))
#else
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_ADDRESS_SAFETY_ANALYSIS
#endif
...
ATTRIBUTE_NO_ADDRESS_SAFETY_ANALYSIS
void ThisFunctionWillNotBeInstrumented() {...}
}}}

You may also ignore certain functions using a blacklist: create a file `my_ignores.txt` and pass it to AddressSanitizer
at compile time using `-fsanitize-blacklist=my_ignores.txt` (This flag is new and is only supported by Clang now):
{{{
# Ignore exactly this function (the names are mangled)
fun:MyFooBar
# Ignore MyFooBar(void) if it is in C++:
fun:_Z8MyFooBarv
# Ignore all function containing MyFooBar
fun:*MyFooBar*
}}}


=FAQ=
  * Q: Can AddressSanitizer continue running after reporting first error? 
  * A: No, sorry. AddressSanitizer errors are fatal. This design choice allows the tool to be faster and simpler.
